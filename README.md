# Deforestation Prediction Model

This project develops a neural network-based model to predict deforestation using historical satellite and geographical data. The model aims to identify areas at risk of deforestation, aiding in more effective resource allocation and conservation efforts.

## Overview

The model uses a Sequential neural network from Keras, optimized through hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner, to predict deforestation based on features derived from satellite imagery and geographical data.

## Model Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Normalization**: Features are scaled between 0 and 1 to facilitate faster and more stable training.
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Rows with missing data are dropped to maintain data integrity.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Features are standardized to minimize bias toward features with larger scales.

2. **Class Imbalance Handling**
   - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: Balances the dataset by synthetically oversampling the minority class.

3. **Model Building and Tuning**
   - **Sequential Model**: Utilizes layers of neurons with activation functions, batch normalization, and dropout layers to manage overfitting.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employs Keras Tuner's Hyperband, optimizing model parameters efficiently.
   - **Early Stopping**: Monitors validation loss to stop training when the model performance no longer improves, preventing overfitting.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Metrics**: Uses accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports to evaluate performance.
   - **False Positives/Negatives Analysis**: Important for understanding the model's impact on resource allocation and conservation efforts.

5. **Visualization**
   - **Training and Validation Metrics**: Plots of accuracy and loss over epochs to visualize learning and generalization.

## Technologies Used

- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides tools for data splitting, feature scaling, and performance metrics.
- **Keras**: For building the neural network model.
- **Keras Tuner**: For optimizing the neural network architecture and parameters.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting training and validation metrics.
- **Imbalanced-Learn (imblearn)**: For handling class imbalance using SMOTE.

## Important Considerations
- Data Quality: The accuracy of predictions heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the input data.
- Model Bias: Adjustments in the model evaluation metrics or loss functions might be necessary to align the model better with specific conservation goals.
- Computational Resources: Hyperparameter tuning and training deep learning models can be resource-intensive. Adequate computational resources are recommended.
